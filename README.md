## Summary

Design a school management system(`backend+dbschema`) that takes down the attendance of the
staff that comes to the school. The administrator of the school can only access the dashboard with
their credentials. 
## Objectives

- [x]  Admin credentials should be salted and hashed.
- [x] Ignore session maintenance[assume session is maintained and only write the APIs].
- [x] Two half days for attendance can be taken as 1 full day.
- [x] Teachers are allowed to take 3 leaves per month without any paycut.
- [x] Admin can see what all teachers are present, absent, half day on present day. 
- [x] Admin can see previous monthâ€™s data for a particular teacher(how many days present,absent, etc.)
- [x] Admin can calculate the salary of teachers based on the number of days present. 
- [x] Admin can also see what all teachers have already taken more than 7 leaves a month[RED FLAG]
- [x] The system should also calculate the salary of teachers for the current month.

- [] Design the database and backend with assumption the school has 10 Million teachers(scale)
You can assume the salary per day same( ex:100 rs/day) for all the teachers.
